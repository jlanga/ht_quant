A Snakemake workflow for Transcriptome Quantification


## Usage

- Test that it works:
  - Make sure you have installed snakemake and run the pipeline with the test
    data: `snakemake --use-conda --jobs 8 all`. It will download all the
    necesary software through conda. It should take less than 5 minutes.

- Run it with your own data:
  - Edit `config/samples.tsv` and add your samples and where are they located.
  - Edit `config/features.yml` with information regarding the reference you are
    using.
  - Edit `config/params.yml` to change the execution of the steps.
  - Run the pipeline: `snakemake --use-conda --jobs 8 all`.
  - (slurm users): `./run_slurm`

## Features

- FASTQ processing with `fastp`
- Mapping with `STAR`
- SAM/BAM/CRAM processing with `samtools`
- Reports with `multiqc` and `FastQC`
